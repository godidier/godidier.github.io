# Car appearance customization

Now let's have some fun with customizing the appearance. When we generated our AI 
agent, it created two rgb files: car1-trb1.rgb and logo.rgb. Those two files are 
respectively used as skin texture for our car and our pit. You can open both 
files with an image editing software such as GIMP (recommended), and modify the 
image while keeping the right proportions. 

Thankfully there is another file car1-trb1.xcf which is a GIMP project file that 
allows us to customize the car skin more effectively.
