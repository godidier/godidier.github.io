# Introduction

Those who have been coding all along, <del>not the copy-pasters</del>, if you 
made some mistakes in the values or operations while coding, the car sometimes 
ended up in the wall and got _stuck_... Yeah I can imagine the frustration...
Even if you "flawlessly" implemented everything, we are still running 
alone on the track. Because we plan to build a agent good enough to race 
against other opponents, we can think of what will happen if an opponent hits
us and we go off-course... We will end up being _stuck_!

But **NO MORE** ! In this chapter, we will implement a recovery strategy to get out 
of an accident and out of being stuck.
