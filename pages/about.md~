# Didier Gohourou

## Bio

I am a computer engineering enthusiast, seeking to get the best out of life, and 
make the world a better place. <del>Yeah, I know that's clich&eacute;.</del>

## Career 

I work as a software engineer. I have some experience in the corporate, academics 
and freelance worlds. I just like building things. I also get involve in open 
source sometimes.

You can take a look at a piece of my CV [here]({static}/docs/godidier_resume.pdf).

## Interests

Pretty much anything funny that will put me in a challenging position. That include
but is not limited to: 

* Sport (mainly Judo)
* Traveling to places where I have no clue about the language/culture
* Drawing places and people
* Being creative with LEGO blocks (a favorite!)
* Keeping up with the state of the art in AI
