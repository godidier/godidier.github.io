# Didier Gohourou

## Bio

I am a computer engineering enthusiast, seeking to get the best out of life, and 
make the world a better place. <del>Yeah, I know that's clich&eacute;.</del>


## Interests

Pretty much anything funny that will put me in a challenging position. That include
but is not limited to: 

* Sport (mainly Judo), Outdoor (Hiking) and Driving / Riding
* Traveling to places where I have no clue about the language/culture
* Being creative (especially with drawing and design as a hobby)
* Learning complex concepts, teach them simply or use them to make stuff
